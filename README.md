# supernatural-monster-recogniser

# About The Project
One of the larger projects of mine at the time of developing.  
I am a big fan of Supernatural show and decided, that a library of monsters/curses/beings/gods would be nice to have.  
So I decided to go through all seasons of Supernatural and collect information needed and input them here in this project.  


# Built With
Python 3.8.0

# Getting started

### Working with supernatural-monster-recogniser:
1. Run the *main.py* or the executable.
2. Choose from one of eight possible options:
    - ***1 - print all monster names*** - prints all monster names currently in a database in the terminal.
    - ***2 - print all monsters with their atributes*** - prints all monster names, a brief description, possible traces or clues they leave behind, disable, killing and curing methods (if available).
    - ***3 - print all clues for monsters*** - prints the list of all the clues, that are currently in the database, that all monsters leave behind.
    - ***4 - find matching monster*** - prints the list of all the clues, just like the prevoius option, but lets you pick all the clues and after that, prints matches with the information of number of hits.
    - ***5 - print all curses names*** - prints all curses names currently in a database in the terminal.
    - ***6 - print all curses with their atributes*** - prints all curses names, a brief description, possible traces or clues they leave behind, disable and killing methods.
    - ***7 - print all clues for curses*** - prints the list of all the clues, that are currently in the database, that all curses leave behind.
    - ***8 - find matching curse*** - prints the list of all the clues, just like the prevoius option, but lets you pick all the clues and after that, prints matches with the information of number of hits.
    - ***0 - exit*** - end the program

# Usage
If you are a fan of Supernatural show, you can play with this project to find out what are the clues, that a particular being leaves behind and try to determine that before Sam and Dean ;)
