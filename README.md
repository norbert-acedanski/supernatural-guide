# About The Project
One of the larger projects of mine at the time of developing.  
I am a big fan of Supernatural show, and I decided, that a library of monsters/curses/beings/gods/objects/places/events would be nice to have in interactive way.  
So I decided to go through all seasons of Supernatural and collect information needed and store them here in this project.  

# Built With
Python 3.9.10

# Getting started

### Working with supernatural-monster-recogniser:
1. Run the *main.py* file.
2. Choose from one of 14 possible options:
    - ***1 - print all monster names*** - prints all monster names currently in a database.
    - ***2 - print all monsters with their attributes*** - prints all monster names, a brief description, episodes, that a monster was seen, possible traces or clues they leave behind, disable, killing and curing methods (if available).
    - ***3 - print all clues for monsters*** - prints the list of all the clues, that are currently in the database, that all monsters leave behind.
    - ***4 - find matching monster*** - prints the list of all the clues, just like the previous option, but lets you pick all the clues and after that, prints matches with the information of number of hits.
    - ***5 - print all curses names*** - prints all curses names currently in a database.
    - ***6 - print all curses with their attributes*** - prints all curses names, a brief description, episodes, that a monster was seen, possible traces or clues they leave behind, disable and killing methods.
    - ***7 - print all clues for curses*** - prints the list of all the clues, that are currently in the database, that all curses leave behind.
    - ***8 - find matching curse*** - prints the list of all the clues, just like the previous option, but lets you pick all the clues and after that, prints matches with the information of number of hits.
    - ***9 - print all objects names*** - prints all objects names currently in a database.
    - ***10 - print all objects with their attributes*** - prints all objects names, a brief description, episodes, that an object was seen, abilities of the object, maintenance and destroy methods (if available).
    - ***11 - print all places names*** - prints all places names currently in a database.
    - ***12 - print all places with their attributes*** - prints all places names, a brief description, episodes, that a place was seen, abilities of the object and clues.
    - ***13 - print all events names*** - prints all events names currently in a database.
    - ***14 - print all events with their attributes*** - prints all events names, a brief description, episodes, that an event was seen, abilities of the object, clues and disable methods (if available).
    - ***0 - exit*** - end the program

# Usage
If you are a fan of Supernatural show, you can play with this project to find out what are the clues, that a particular entity/curse/event/object/place leaves behind and try to determine that like Sam and Dean would ;)  

# TODO:
- finish all seasons and episodes.
- fill missing appearances of John Winchester's Journal until S04E19.
