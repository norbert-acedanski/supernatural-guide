# About The Project
One of the larger projects of mine at the time of developing.  
I am a big fan of Supernatural show, and I decided, that a library of monsters/curses/beings/gods/objects/places/events would be nice to have in interactive way.  
So I decided to go through all seasons of Supernatural and collect information needed and store them here in this project.  
It is inspired by Charlie's application seen in S08E20, where she has created an app to determine what monster is being hunted.

# Built With
Python 3.9.10
